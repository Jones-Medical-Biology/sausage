# Sausage

## Info

This is a general-purpose bioinformatics library with the goal of having excellent

 1. documentation,
 2. reproducibility, and
 3. extensibility

with less debuging. The choice of Haskell is to make it possible for
researchers to expertly define workflows and pipelines without
requiring expertise in software engineering.

) might be helpful. It suggests using Cancer-associated fibroblasts

Started constructing types and began to test a parser implementation
using Tsoding's JSON parser YouTube video as reference.
